# leaflet-challenge

This project consisted of using Javascript, API calls, OpenMaps, and Leaflet to create a map of seismic activity with data
pulled from the United States Geological Survey website. The Earthquake data is all earthquakes recorded in the previous week.

There are three tile layers and two overlay maps available:
- A street map, dark map, and satellite map tile layers, and
- One overlay for the earthquake data, with markers color coded and sized according to the magnitude, and
- An overlay that shows fault lines with data pulled from a github repo

These layers can be turned on and off.

The challenges from this project came from making sure the code was clean and easy to follow. At times, I felt I was writing
overly complex code. I feel the final result is readable, and as always, there is room for improvment.

Next steps:
- Create a map using data on other phenomenon, such as tornado or hurricane tracking
